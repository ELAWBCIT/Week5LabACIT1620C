        <h3>About Ernest Law</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Ernest Law and I am attending the British Columbia Institute of Technology, one of the <em>hardest</em> polytechnic institutions in British Columbia.
        Failing BCIT is <strong>NOT</strong> an option for me as I never thought I'd make it to this school. I do not want to give up this opportunity.
