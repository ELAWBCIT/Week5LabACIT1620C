        <h3>All about Ernest Law</h3> 
        <p>
            My name is Ernest Law and I am attending the British Columbia Institute of Technology, one of the <em>hardest</em> polytechnic institutions in British Columbia. <br>
        </br> Failing BCIT is <strong>NOT</strong> an option for me as I never thought I'd make it to this school. I do not want to give up this opportunity.
